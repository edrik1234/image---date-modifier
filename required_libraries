About Tkinter:
tkinter does not get installed via pip because it's part of the standard library in most Python distributions(in windows).

On Linux, you may need to install it separately via your system package manager. For example:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

On Mac, it should be included, but if not, reinstall Python via Homebrew or python.org.

About tesseract:
pytesseract requires you to install the Tesseract-OCR engine separately:
Windows: Download and install from my folder of tesseract
Linux:
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
Mac:
brew install tesseract
