🚀 Automate Date Editing in Images – My New Python Project!

Manually changing timestamps in images is time-consuming, so I built a tool that does it automatically! 🖥📸

✅ What It Does:
🔹 Select the exact area where the date appears
🔹 Uses Tesseract OCR to detect text
🔹 Replaces it while preserving style & format
🔹 Works with JPG, PNG, BMP, and more!

🔧 How to Use:
1️⃣ Install Python dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
2️⃣ Install Tesseract OCR & place files in the project folder
3️⃣ Open the project in Visual Studio Code
4️⃣ Run the script and modify image dates easily!
